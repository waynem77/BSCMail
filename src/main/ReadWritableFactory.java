 * A factory that creates a {@link ReadWritable} from a set of read-writable

 * {@link ReadWritable#getReadWritableProperties()}, but more typically are
 * extracted from a disk file.
 *
 * It is recommended that {@code ReadWritableFactory} implementations be
 * generous in extracting values from the properties, as values may be encoded
 * in different (but compatible) ways. For instance, a {@link Boolean} could be
 * encoded as a Boolean or as the string "true" or "false". In particular,
 * read-writables may be encoded as objects or as nested property maps.

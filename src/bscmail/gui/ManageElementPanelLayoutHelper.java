/**
 * A suggested layout helper for implementations of {
 *
 * @linl ManageElementPanel}. This class is used to set the panel's layout
 * manager to {@link GridBagLayout}, and has methods for pairing components with
 * identifying labels in rows.
 *
 * To use this layout helper, first set the layout manager via
 * {@link #setLayoutManager()}, and then sequentially add components along with
 * their identifying strings via the {@link #addComponent(String, Component)}
 * method. Each label and component take up a single row in the container, and
 * appear in the order they are entered.
